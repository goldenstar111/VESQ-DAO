### What is Vesq Finance?
[Vesq](https://www.vesq.io/) is the first decentralized cross-chain reserve currency protocol on the VSQ token. Each VSQ token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g., MIM, VSQ-MATIC LP Tokens etc etc) in the VESQ treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. VESQ also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and minting. 

### What is Staking?
**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Vesq**. Stakers stake their TIME tokens on Vesq Website to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceed from bond sales, and can vary based on the number of TIME staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.
Staking is a passive, long-term strategy. The increase in your stake of TIME translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of TIME drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your staked TIME balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.
When you stake, you lock TIME and receive an equal amount of MEMOries. Your MEMOries balance rebases up automatically at the end of every epoch. MEMOries is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.
When you unstake, you burn MEMOries and receive an equal amount of TIME tokens. Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked TIME (if any) will continue to receive rebase rewards.
